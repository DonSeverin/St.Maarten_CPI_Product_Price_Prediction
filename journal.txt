Ridge Regression Notes

Adding scaling to ridge regression seeminly boosts performance

 If the test statistic is more negative than 
 the critical value, you can reject the null hypothesis 
 and conclude that the time series is stationary.

 example = -3 < -1

 If the test statistic is less negative than 
 the critical value, you cannot reject the null hypothesis 
 and conclude that the time series has a unit root.

 example =



  If the p-value is less than the significance(0.05) level, you can reject 
  the null hypothesis and conclude that the time series is stationary.
